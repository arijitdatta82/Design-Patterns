# State Design Pattern

## Definition
The state design pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It achieves this by encapsulating the objectâ€™s behavior within different state objects, and the object itself dynamically switches between these state objects depending on its current state.

## Real-Time Code Example
In this real time example, we are using state design pattern to maintain the state of a purchase order. Based on the current state of an order it can determine its next or previous state.
[source code](State.cs)

<b>State</b> defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.
```
    public interface IOrderState
	{
		void SetNextState(PurchaseOrder po);
		void SetPrevState(PurchaseOrder po);
	}
```

<b>ConcreteState</b> implements a behavior associated with a state of Context
```
	public class NewOrder : IOrderState
	{
		public void SetNextState(PurchaseOrder po)
		{
			po.State = new ProcessOrder();
		}
		
		public void SetPrevState(PurchaseOrder po)
		{
			po.State = this;
		}
	}
```

<b>Context</b> defines the interface of interest to clients and maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.
```
	public class PurchaseOrder
	{
		IOrderState _currentState;
		string _orderNum;
		public PurchaseOrder(string orderNum)
		{
			_currentState = new NewOrder();
			_orderNum = orderNum;
			Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Purchase order {0} is creted with state: {1}", _orderNum, _currentState.GetType().Name));
		}
		public IOrderState State
        {
            get { return _currentState; }
            set
            {
                _currentState = value;
                Console.WriteLine(string.Format("State of {0} is set to: {1}", _orderNum, _currentState.GetType().Name));
            }
        }
		public void Next()
		{
			_currentState.SetNextState(this);
		}
		public void Previous()
		{
			_currentState.SetPrevState(this);
		}
	}
```

<b>Client Code:</b>
```
    PurchaseOrder order = new PurchaseOrder("PO-000001");
    order.Next();
    order.Next();
    order.Next();
    order.Previous();
    Console.WriteLine("---------------------------------------------------");
```

<b>Output:</b>
```
Purchase order PO-000001 is creted with state: NewOrder
State of PO-000001 is set to: ProcessOrder
State of PO-000001 is set to: ShipOrder
State of PO-000001 is set to: CompleteOrder
State of PO-000001 is set to: ShipOrder
---------------------------------------------------
